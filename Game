"""Number guessing game inspired by Alice in Borderland S2 Japanese Thriller. The game starts by chosing the number
 of players from 2 to 10, it then assigns each player
 a default score of 0, each player must choose a number from 0-100,
 the average of all chosen numbers are found and mulriplied by 0.8, the player whos number is closest to the results earns a point.
5 points are required to win the game"""
